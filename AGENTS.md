## 1. What this is

A tutor-marketplace web app for **Ghanaian students — KNUST engineering
courses first**. Students find approved tutors, start a conversation, and get
scheduled for sessions; the **admin team** approves tutors and verifies
attendance. Prices are in Ghana Cedis (GH₵). Built as a **modular monolith** on
Next.js with a dedicated service layer so the same logic can later power a
mobile app.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions, Turbopack)
· TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · Supabase **PostgreSQL only** (no Supabase Auth)
· self-hosted auth (scrypt + sessions) · Zod · lucide-react icons · **npm**
(never pnpm — symlink issues on Windows).

**Deployment repo:** https://github.com/raidenkhan/Harcort-educational-consult
(branch `main`). The app is hosted from there; `.env.local` is NOT committed.

## 2. Project history (chronological)

- **Phase 0 — foundation.** Full schema (profiles, courses, tutor_profiles,
  tutor_services, conversations, messages, admin_audit_log, reports), RLS,
  admin approve/reject RPCs, realtime publication, seed taxonomy.
- **Ghana pivot.** KNUST engineering course catalog added; currency switched
  to GH₵; copy re-targeted to Ghanaian students.
- **Auth modal + design system.** Sign in/sign up moved into a modal (tabs,
  Escape/backdrop to close, `?auth=` auto-open). Brand moved off blue →
  warm amber/gold (`brand-*`) + petrol teal (`petrol-*`). Fonts: Space Grotesk
  (display) + Inter (body), locally bundled. Emoji-free (lucide-react icons).
  Motion: marquee, staggered hero entrance, modal scale-in, button press
  feedback — all `prefers-reduced-motion` aware.
- **Self-hosted auth (big pivot).** Supabase Auth was dropped entirely because
  of email rate limits / confirmation emails. Now: own `credentials` table
  (scrypt-hashed passwords), `sessions` table (SHA-256-hashed opaque tokens,
  30-day expiry), atomic `register_user` RPC, brute-force throttle on sign-in,
  middleware = cheap cookie-presence check only. All data access moved to the
  **service-role client with explicit scoping** (browser never touches the DB).
- **Password reset without email.** Email recovery is unavailable (Supabase
  auth rate limits), so admins issue one-time 8-digit codes from `/admin`
  (hashed at rest, single-use, 30-min expiry) and share them out-of-band
  (WhatsApp/phone). Students redeem them at `/forgot-password` (throttled,
  no session required); redeeming revokes all of the user's sessions.
- **Bento design + tutoring sessions.** Admin/tutor/dashboard pages got bento
  grid backdrops. New `tutoring_sessions` table: tutors schedule sessions with
  students who contacted them; **both** tutor and student tick attendance when
  they meet; the admin's Attendance Tracker sees both ticks (proves tutors are
  working). Cancellations are now **soft-deletes** (status `cancelled` + who/when)
  so the admin keeps an audit trail.
- **Performance.** Home page tutor/course listings cached with
  `unstable_cache` (5-min TTL, tag-invalidated on admin approve/reject).
- **Contact-tutor flow + chat page.** The old "Contact tutor" CTA was just an
  auth-modal trigger — it never checked the session. It's now session-aware:
  signed-out visitors get the modal, signed-in students start a real
  conversation (re-using an existing one on duplicate) and land in `/chat`.
  `/chat` lists conversations with names + last-message previews, shows the
  thread, and has a composer. New messages appear via 5s `router.refresh()`
  polling (browser realtime is impossible without Supabase Auth/RLS session).
- **Tutor directory (`/tutors`).** Public browse/search page: client-side text
  + subject filtering over the cached approved-tutor list, credential-rich
  cards (qualifications, per-course pricing), session-aware Contact button.
  All browse CTAs (dashboard, home nav + hero, chat empty state) point here.
  `BentoBackdrop` was softened (no hard square tiles — blurred panels +
  faint grid) and the home hero blurs `gradback.jpg` slightly to hide
  gradient banding.
- **Payment ground rules + admin contact.** Policy: students make and
  discuss payments ONLY with admins, never tutors. Rendered as a card on the
  student dashboard and a compact banner on `/chat` (student role only) via
  `src/components/support/PaymentGroundRules.tsx`. The WhatsApp CTA links to
  `wa.me` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WHATSAPP` (`src/lib/config.ts`) — the button
  hides until the number is configured.

## 3. Architecture

```
src/
├─ app/                  → App Router: marketing, (app) dashboards, (auth) pages
│  └─ (app)/             → dashboard/ (all roles), tutor/, admin/ (role-gated)
├─ services/             ← ALL business logic. UI never queries Supabase directly.
│  ├─ auth/              → sign-up/sign-in/sign-out actions, getCurrentProfile,
│  │                        requireProfile / requireRole guards
│  ├─ tutors/            → approved-tutor listings (cached), onboarding forms
│  ├─ courses/           → taxonomy + search (cached)
│  ├─ sessions/          → tutoring timetable: schedule, confirm attendance
│  │                        (dual ticks), cancel (soft)
│  ├─ chat/              → /chat page: conversation list (names + last-message
│  │                        preview), thread, composer; polling refresh
│  ├─ admin/             → approval workflow (RPCs) + audit log
│  └─ moderation/        → reports & blocks
├─ lib/                  → supabase clients, auth primitives (password, session),
│  │                        time formatting (Accra), cn()
├─ components/           → ui/ primitives (Card, Button, Badge, Field(s),
│  │                        Container, BentoBackdrop), auth/, tutor/, sessions/
└─ types/                → shared domain types mirroring the DB
```

**Data-access pattern (critical):** server components/actions use
`createAdminClient()` (service-role) and scope every query explicitly to the
acting session profile. Pages gate with `requireRole("admin")` / `requireRole(
"tutor")` / `requireProfile()`. RLS exists but is **deny-all for private
tables** — the app layer is the real authorization boundary.

**Time handling:** all meeting times render in **Accra time** via
`src/lib/time.ts` (`Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: "Africa/Accra"`).
Ghana is GMT with no DST, so strings are identical server & client — this
avoids both the server-timezone bug and hydration mismatches. Never
`toLocaleDateString` without an explicit timezone.

## 4. Database schema (migrations, in order)

All under `supabase/migrations/` — apply in the Supabase SQL Editor, in order,
and all are safe to re-run:

| Migration | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0001_init.sql` | Enums, tables (profiles → tutor_profiles → tutor_services, courses, conversations, messages, admin_audit_log, reports), RLS, admin RPCs, status-guard trigger, realtime publication, seed taxonomy |
| `0002_knust_engineering_courses.sql` | KNUST engineering course catalog (on-conflict upsert) |
| `0003_self_hosted_auth.sql` | Decouples `profiles.id` from `auth.users`; `credentials` + `sessions` (deny-all RLS); `register_user` RPC; `is_admin(uuid)`; admin RPCs keyed by `actor_id` + GUC (`request.harcot.actor_id`); status-guard trigger rewritten |
| `0004_tutoring_sessions.sql` | `tutoring_sessions` (tutor_profile_id, student_id, scheduled_at, duration_minutes, topic, location, notes, `tutor_confirmed_at`, `student_confirmed_at`) — deny-all RLS |
| `0005_session_cancellations.sql` | `session_status` enum (`scheduled`/`cancelled`) + `status`, `cancelled_at`, `cancelled_by` columns — soft delete for cancellations |
| `0006_password_resets.sql` | `password_resets` — admin-issued one-time reset codes (SHA-256 hashed, single-use, 30-min expiry), deny-all RLS |

Key security properties:
- **No Supabase Auth.** Passwords live only in `credentials`; sessions in
  `sessions` (token hash). `register_user` blocks self-promotion to admin.
- **Admin RPCs** (`admin_approve_tutor(actor_id, target_id, note)`) verify the
  actor's id against `profiles` inside Postgres, then set the GUC the
  status-guard trigger checks. App code passes the session profile id.

---

## 5. Code conventions

- **Server actions** (`"use server"` in `services/*/mutations.ts`) return a
  `{ error?, message? }` state object for `useActionState` forms; admin
  approve/reject throw on error (plain forms). Always `revalidatePath` the
  affected routes after mutation.
- **Validation:** Zod schemas live in `services/*/schemas.ts`; every server
  action parses form input at the boundary.
- **React Compiler purity:** lint enforces `react-hooks/purity` — **no
  `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`/impure calls inside component render**. Extract
  time-dependent logic to module-level functions (see `splitTimetable` in
  `src/app/(app)/tutor/page.tsx`) and pass snapshots down as props
  (see `SessionCard`'s `now` prop).
- **Caching:** public read queries use `unstable_cache` from `next/cache` with
  `tags` + a TTL (see `listApprovedTutors`, `listCourses`). Invalidate from
  server actions with Next 16's two-arg form
  `revalidateTag("tutors", "max")` (plus `revalidatePath("/")`) in every
  mutation that changes the cached data — admin approve/reject, tutor
  profile/service edits.
- **UI:** Tailwind v4; design tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (`brand-*`
  amber, `petrol-*` teal, `font-display` Space Grotesk). **No emojis** — use
  lucide-react icons. Reuse `Card`/`Badge`/`Button`/`Container`/`Field(s)`.
  Interior pages get a `BentoBackdrop` (tone `amber`|`petrol`) inside a
  `relative overflow-hidden` wrapper.
- **Errors:** never expose raw DB errors to users beyond `error.message` in
  form states.

## 6. Environment & setup

`.env.local` (gitignored; template in `.env.example`):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=   # REQUIRED — everything runs through this
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WHATSAPP=   # student Contact-admin WhatsApp button (digits only, e.g. 233201234567)
```

Setup runbook:
1. `npm install`
2. Apply migrations 0001→0005 in the Supabase SQL Editor
3. `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000 (no confirmation emails — sign-up
   signs you in immediately)
4. Promote yourself to admin:
   ```sql
   update public.profiles set role = 'admin'
   where id = (select profile_id from public.credentials where email = 'you@example.com');
   ```

Validation commands: `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run build`.
The dev machine is slow — give compiles 30–60s.

## 7. Known quirks & gotchas

- **Next 16.3 dev-mode middleware doesn't run in this environment** (project
  sits under `C:\Users\User`; a Turbopack-dev quirk). Production builds are
  fine (`ƒ Proxy (Middleware)` appears in the build). `next.config.ts` pins
  `outputFileTracingRoot` + `turbopack.root` to the project — **keep those**;
  removing them makes Next scan the home directory and breaks proxy discovery.
  Page-level guards are the authoritative defense and cover dev.
- **`next build` and `next dev` share `.next`** — running one after the other
  without `rm -rf .next` causes stale-chunk failures (sign-in "Failed to
  fetch"). Always clean-restart.
- **Stale environment variables beat `.env.local`.** Next.js never overrides
  an existing env var with a file value. If `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (or
  the other Supabase vars) is set to the old placeholder in the shell,
  every DB call fails with "Invalid API key" and pages silently render empty
  (e.g. "No tutors yet"). Launch with
  `env -u SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY -u NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL -u
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY npm run dev`, or unset the stale vars first.
- **Supabase Auth is NOT used** — never add `supabase.auth.*` calls back.
  Email "rate limits" don't exist here by design.
- Browser-automation agents (browser-use) have been unreliable in this
  environment — prefer curl + code inspection for verification.
- The GitHub repo is `Harcort-educational-consult` (note the spelling) —
  project folder is `harcot-educational-consult`.

---

## 8. Direction / roadmap

**Near term:**
- Google sign-in — slot into the existing `credentials` table (schema is
  ready: add an `auth_provider`/`provider_id` column when implementing).
- Realtime chat upgrade — a polling-based `/chat` page is live; switch the
  thread to `supabase_realtime` subscriptions once a Supabase-Auth-backed
  path exists (or keep polling — it's fine at this scale). Unread counts.
- Session reminders (email/WhatsApp) before scheduled meetings.
- Weekly calendar view of the timetable; live "now" ticker so the confirm
  button appears the moment a session starts.
- Cancellation-rate warnings on the admin page for tutors who cancel a lot.
- Admin moderation UI for `reports`.

**Later:**
- Payments (Stripe), bookings, reviews.
- Mobile app (React Native / Expo) consuming the same backend.
- Test suite (the repo currently has none) + CI (lint/typecheck/build) on the
  GitHub repo before hosting.
- Hosting: the GitHub repo is the deployment source (Vercel or similar);
  remember the `.env.local` vars must be set in the host's env.
